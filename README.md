Code for the paper "Variations on a theme of Euler" in SIREV 2016

The link in the paper was to my old web page at Western, which has gone down permanently in all the various contreremps that happened around the time I left.  In 2016, however, I had no idea that Western was not going to manage that transition very well, otherwise I would have moved to GitHub earlier.
