# OptimalResiduals (was: Leaky-Bucket)
Code for the paper "Variations on a theme of Euler" (written with Julia Jankowski) in SIREV 2016 and related papers

The paper can be found at https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/15M1032351

The link in that 2016 paper was to my old web page at Western, which has gone down permanently in all the various contreremps that happened around the time I left.  In 2016, however, I had no idea that Western was not going to manage that transition very well, otherwise I would have moved to GitHub earlier.

Follow up papers appeared in CCA and in Numerical Algorithms.
